*You can find my ipython notebook about the parser of the project, at the [Python Thessaloniki Meetup files](https://github.com/skorokithakis/pythess-files/tree/master/One%20Direction/Linear%20Programming%20Parser). There is also a "demo" [gist](https://gist.github.com/sirodoht/178e5c2ad1cee950ca5e) for the parser.*
