Solver for linear programming problems.

This is side project which started from a university course. Intended to become a minimal solver for linear programming problems utilizing the (dual) simplex algorithm, two scaling techniques and NumPy.

*You can find my ipython notebook about the parser of the project, at the [Python Thessaloniki Meetup files](https://github.com/skorokithakis/pythess-files/tree/master/One%20Direction/Linear%20Programming%20Parser). There is also a "demo" [gist](https://gist.github.com/sirodoht/178e5c2ad1cee950ca5e) for the parser.*
